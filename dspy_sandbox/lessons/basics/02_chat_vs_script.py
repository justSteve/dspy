Lesson 02: Chat vs Script - Understanding the Paradigm Shift
============================================================

This lesson shows the fundamental difference between "chatting" with
an LLM and "scripting" with DSPy. We'll solve the same problem both
ways to see why scripting is more powerful for building systems.

Key Concepts:
- Chat paradigm: Unstructured, conversational, unpredictable
- Script paradigm: Structured, functional, predictable
- Why scripting enables building reliable AI systems

    I bought this coffee maker last month and I have mixed feelings.
    On the positive side, it makes great coffee and heats up quickly.
    The design is sleek and doesn't take much counter space.
    However, it's quite expensive and the water reservoir is small,
    so I have to refill it often. The controls are a bit confusing at first.
    Overall, I'd probably recommend it to coffee enthusiasts who don't mind
    the price, but casual coffee drinkers might want something simpler.

CHAT PARADIGM:
- You're having a conversation
- Outputs are unpredictable text
- Integration is difficult
- Each prompt is standalone

SCRIPT PARADIGM:
- You're writing a program
- Outputs are structured data
- Integration is natural
- Operations compose together

This shift from CHATTING to SCRIPTING is what makes DSPy powerful
for building real AI systems, not just demos.
